passdown.py
==========

A simple Python script that helps my dad (a mechanic in a factory) write his nightly passdown email.

Automates and simplifies the process so he doesn't have to hunt and peck anymore. After a series of prompts, generates
a pretty HTML table with the status of the lines and his comments. Then emails it to whoever he wants through a dummy gmail account.

My first script, so be gentle! Not a masterpiece by any means.
